You are an expert in England and Wales law. You are to determine whether or not a case qualifies as an easement, using the following summary:

Easements
Can be legal - LPA s.1(2)(a)
Phipps v Pears - positive and negative. Rights of way vs right to light
Definition of an Easement
Re Ellenborough Park 
Dominant + Servient Tenement
Easement must accommodate the DT
DT and ST owner must be different persons
Right claimed must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant
Dominant and Servient Tenement
Rangley - Easement cannot be attached to a person - must benefit the estate in land, and burden another 
Must Accommodate the DT
Propinquity of Tenements
Bailey v Stephens - Two plots of land must be close to each other
Re Ellenborough Park - Some houses didn’t border the path - easement found 
Most Accommodate DT, rather than confer mere personal advantage
Regency - Enjoyment of the right must be to do with the normal use of the DT (i.e business/residential use) - Can just be a contemplated use 

i) Regency - No requirement for easement to be ancillary to enjoyment of DT - as long as for benefit of DT - matters not enjoyment is primary reasons people buy units

ii) Dominant land running a business
Moody v Steggles - Hanging sign - easement - benefits land for business purposes - not as a pub
Cf Hill v Tupper - pleasure boats - personal right – but Re E and Regency rationalise case as C trying to create a monopoly w/ no normal connection to ordinary use of land (policy argument)

iii) Recreational use
Re E - pleasure gardens - function of garden (communal townhouses)
Regency - Recreational use ‘small step’ from Re E, physical exercise part of UK daily routine. 
→ Justified on the nature of the activity, not the essential function (timeshare units normally for holiday) - so more holistic look at the accommodation question 

iv) About if the type of easement accommodates the DT, not if it is doing so
Gosling v Bradbury - Easement cannot cease to exist if it stops accommodating at a certain time - i.e right to receive water when water becomes contaminated 
Must be used for the DT only
Harris v Flower - Pub Extension - On additional land - easement only for DT
Peacock v Custins - Farmer - Not ancillary use - not allowed - Burden on ST not to be increased without his consent 
Massey v Boulden - home extension - village green - not ancillary use
Macepark - explains ancillary doctrine	
Right must not “in substance” be used for benefit of non-dominant land
This happens when
→ No benefit to non-dominant land
→ extent of use for benefit of non-dominant land is insubstantial 
→ ‘benefit’ - use such that a profit can be made from the use of the non-dominant land (commercial value important factor too)
Giles v Tarry - No Easement - about intention of C trying to get around not having easement
Gore v Naheed - Purpose of original easement for a granary, not garage. This is the benefit
c) DT and ST owners must be different persons
Parshall v Bryans - No easement to park could be acquired the RP of both DT and ST
d) Right Claimed must be capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant
Regency - Residual category. Clearly defined, not so invasive as to oust SO of control, no obligation on SO
Capable Grantor and Grantee (legal capacity)
Within the General Nature of Rights Traditionally Recognsied as Easements
i) Recognising new easements
Dyce v Hay - need to be aware of “changing circumstances of society”
Keppell v Bailey - not at “fancy or caprice” of Owner 

Examples:
Miller v Emcer Products - using loo, Coventry v Lawrence - making noise, Crow v Wood - build a fence, Cardell - Generate electricity, Wolverhampton - rights of air traffic
Regency - Recreation/sport - universally of benefit to human beings - law must be open to “new types of property ownership and new ways of enjoying the use of land” 
Phipps v Pears - negative easements - basically closed list
→ Right to flow of water through artificial channel
→ Right to flow of air
→ Right to light
→ Right of support for buildings

ii) No Positive Burden on ST - Gives DT ‘step-in rights’ 
Redman - no duty to provide heated pipes
Gosling - no duty for S to provide power to pump water
Exception - maintaining a fence - Crow v Wood and Haddock 
Jones v Pritchard - Step-in can be extensive - rebuilding bridge
Regency - No obligation to maintain leisure facilities. But fine to expect SO will undertake management/maintenance/repair - just no legal obligation 
→ So in theory - super wide step-in rights - how does it interact w/ ‘virtual possession’ and excessive use? Basically organising a managing a ‘leisure complex’ 

iii) Sufficiently Defined right
William Aldred’s Case - no right to view - 
Webb v Bird - Blocking windmill - too indefinite
Re E - right to use a garden - not a general right to wander 
Regency - What standard to uphold? functional/reasonable? Fully desirable? De minimis? 

iv) Ouster Principle - Cannot leave servient owner w/o any reasonable use of his land
Exclusive use can trigger if on a positive, permanent/subsantial basis
→ Reilly v Booth - use of gateway, Fowler  - use of tunnel
→ But not if insubstantial
Bowley - Permanent occupation by pipe - negligible. Same as Moody 
Lancashire - running TV wires not too invasive, but was in Aus Harada (about extent)

Exclusionary Use
Copeland - parking ‘virtually claim for possession’ - didn’t cite Macadam (Coal shed)
Gillman - Easement - 1 Car, space for 4
Batchelor - 6 cars in area for 6, all working hours - no easement - no reasonable use 
Moncrieff - 1 car 1 spot - Easement - about if SO retains possession and control of ST. Still do stuff above and below/walls. 
Application:
Virdi - 1 car 1 space, C owns part of space - Easement - reasonable alternative use - grow shrubs, put up signs, change surface. 
Kettel - 1 space 1 car - Easement - look at context - express grant + residential 
De Le Cuona - 2 space out of 16 - not exclusive or exclusionary
→ Note - no issue w/ communal rights to park if there are multiple grantees. Exclusion caused by disparate DOs

Creation of an Easement
Express grant/reservation
Easements Legal or Equitable
i) Formalities to create at law
Deed - LPA 1925 s.52(1)
Registration - LRA 2002, ss27(1) and 27(2)(d) - LPA 1925 s1(2)(a)
ii) Examples of Equitable Easements
S is an equitable estate
P.E - Chaudhary v Yavuz 
Just a contract - Walsh v Lonsdale - LPMPA s.2 
Ancillary Rights can be implied to express easements
Jones v Pritchard - reasonably necessary for its exercise and enjoyment
Moncrieff - Existing easement to drive - ancillary right to park - though difficult geography here
b) Implied Grant/Reservation
Only arise upon Subdivision of land
Easements legal or equitable
Corresponds to status of transferred estate (LC) - implied into deed
LRA 2002 s.27(7) - examples implied easements from need registration 
Implied Grant v Reservation
Walby - If grantor of land wishes to reserve an easement - should do some expressly - Waddington too
Implied Grant - Reservation - only necessity and intended use
i) Easements of Necessity
Union Lighterage - w/o implication easement “cannot be used at all”
Manjang - No easement - D could access land via a river
Barraclough - “implication from the circumstances” - not policy? 
North Sydney Printing - No easement - C intended to speculate w/ land, not develop it
ii) Easements of Intended Use
Pwllbach - common intention that subject of the grant should be used in some definite manner - is the easement necessary to give effect to this
Wong v Beaumont - Extraction duct required  by health inspector - granted
Donovan v Rana - Easement - “modern” dwelling needs “modern” utilities - can lay them 
Linvale - Easement - right of way to escape from C’s fire doors
iii) Rule in Wheeldon v Burrows
Wheeldon - ‘quasi-easements’ 

Quasi-Easement “continuous and apparent”
Borman v Griffith - Use of a road - easement arose - Not continuous (driving!) - but reasonably so, but very apparent from a physical inspection. 

Necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted
Wheeler v JJ Saunders - Necessity wider here than in easements of necessity. But failed here.
Borman - access route for heavy vehicles needed for DT’s business. 
→ Practically needed, not just convenient
Taurusbuild - easement - alternative access is not fatal - here - necessary for DT to have access to the front of the property for vehicles. Back access not for vehicular access
Unclear if first two rules are both needed. Wheeler says alternative, Millman says cumulative. LC echoes

Owners of the entirety enjoy the quasi-easement for the benefit of the part granted
→ Unclear if a requirement  - O must occupy both plots before conveyance? Seen so in Kent v Kavanagh 

Exercised prior and up to the transfer, and no contrary intention

iv) LPA 1925 s.62(1)
Includes all ‘rights’ 
International Tea Stores - Bare licence upgraded to easement of a right of way - needed to allow C to enjoy plot as previous tenant did

Must be a legal estate, w/ prior diversity of occupation or continuous and apparent use 
Wood v Waddington - Only applies to rights enjoyed at time of conveyance - reasonable period
Goldberg v Edwards - Right of way during licencee turned into easement as tenant 
Platt v Crouch - X got an easement to moor - Two requirements above are alternative - Backed by Wood 

No contrary intent from deed of conveyance - Browning v Jack 
Unlike Wheeldon - no necessity basis, and can only be legal
Prescription
20 years - generally legal. Moncrieff - applies to all forms of easements
i) Qualifying use: user ‘as of right’
Earl de Warr v Miles - nec vi, nec clam, nec precario - if present, as per Redcar - unacceptable for C to acquire rights

Nec vi
Newnham v Willison - having to break upon a gate - violence
Smith v Brudenell-Bruce - Continuing to use despite protest - violence 
Redcar - “something which he was not entitled to do after the owner had told him not to do it”
Winterburn - request not to park - violence 

Nec clam
Sturgers - ST cannot ‘consent’ w/o knowledge, actual or constructive 
Union Lighterage - objective test - can’t see underground rods - secrecy 

Nec precario 
Odey v Barber - permission given by owners - unsolicited - was permission
ii) Use for benefit and against freehold titles
Tenants accrue for underlying freehold. Llewellyn, China Field Ltd 
iii) Prescriptive period
Prescription at common law - 20 years use - law presumes right has extend since time immemorial 1189 - easily rebutted
Doctrine of lost modern grant - 20 years - assume right enjoyed pursuant to a lawful grant 
Bryant v Foot. In Tehidy Minerals - a ‘legal fiction’ 
Prescription Act 1832
20 years - defeated by an interruption. 40 years - gives an “absolute and indefeasible right”
→ If there are easements of light - s.3 - arises after 20 years use, regardless of party capacity, need not be ‘as of right’. Defeated w/ consent or agreement 
iv) Human Rights - 
Pye v UK - losing less than AP - not issue?

Transmissibility of Easements
Benefit
Legal - run with the land 
Equitable - LPA s.62
Burden
Depends on priority - Legal - ss.28/29 and Sched.3.para.3 - overrides
Same rules (para.2) instead. Chaudhary tried - but just using it was not A.O
Note - creation of an easement may trigger s.29, but creation is not in itself an overreaching conveyance - Baker v Craggs 

Extinguishing - Unity of possession and ownership, release, abandonment (Dwyer), and Rules relating to easements enjoyed w/ leases that are terminated (Wall v Collins) 

You must now return a JSON object which represents a tree structure. At each node, a question must be asked to determine whether an easement applies and, if so, what type of easement.
