    """Creates a graph that works with a chat model that utilizes tool calling.

    Args:
        model: The `LangChain` chat model that supports tool calling.
        tools: A list of tools or a ToolExecutor instance.
        messages_modifier: An optional
            messages modifier. This applies to messages BEFORE they are passed into the LLM.
            Can take a few different forms:
            - SystemMessage: this is added to the beginning of the list of messages.
            - str: This is converted to a SystemMessage and added to the beginning of the list of messages.
            - Callable: This function should take in a list of messages and the output is then passed to the language model.
            - Runnable: This runnable should take in a list of messages and the output is then passed to the language model.
        checkpointer: An optional checkpoint saver object. This is useful for persisting
            the state of the graph (e.g., as chat memory).
        interrupt_before: An optional list of node names to interrupt before.
            Should be one of the following: "agent", "tools".
            This is useful if you want to add a user confirmation or other interrupt before taking an action.
        interrupt_after: An optional list of node names to interrupt after.
            Should be one of the following: "agent", "tools".
            This is useful if you want to return directly or run additional processing on an output.
        debug: A flag indicating whether to enable debug mode.

    Returns:
        A compiled LangChain runnable that can be used for chat interactions.
